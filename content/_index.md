## My work

I've worked in the tech industry as a technical communicator for over a decade. Most recently I’ve worked for a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics documenting every nook and cranny of a cloud telecommunications messaging solution. Previously, I worked in the e-learning industry creating technical courseware and training manuals aimed at organizations big and small.

## I mostly write about these things

**📝 Technical communication** <br> 
Too often, the barrier between good software and great software is inadequate documentation. I share personal learnings on how to break down this barrier to provide users and developers with the resources to take software to its true capabilities. 

**🗃️ Content strategy**<br>
Content strategy focuses on the planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content—and most sites don't do it. I write about how to use content strategy to vastly improve user experience.  

**✔️ Productivity** <br>
Progress is incremental with no guarantee of incrementing. Productivity is there to keep you on track, but it's important not to get carried away with tools and processes. I share what I've learned works for me, and I hope it'll work for you too.
