## My work

I worked in the tech industry as a technical writer for close to a decade. Most recently I've worked for a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics documenting every nook and cranny of a cloud telecommunications messaging solution for telecom operators. Previously I worked in a the e-learning industry creating technical courseware and training manuals for companies big and small.

## I write about these things

**Technical writing**  
I don't talk about remote work in vague terms or in an attempt to sell the lifestyle. I share a candid, honest perspective from 3+ years of working remotely, including leading teams of 20+.

**Communication in the tech industry**  
The story of overnight success is a myth. I share personal learnings and struggles of my journey in becoming a developer, an entrepreneur, and a forever learner.

## My newsletter
I have a monthly newsletter that I send. It tends to cover some stuff that’s been on my mind, some info about posts both from this blog and elsewhere, and some insider stuff that I don’t publish anywhere else.
