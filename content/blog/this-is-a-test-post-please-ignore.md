I have worked in the cyber security industry for well over a decade now. Currently I am the digital forensics and incident response lead across Europe 🇪🇺 for Bank of America 💵 🇺🇸. I’ve been at the Bank since 2017 and it’s the most interesting job I’ve ever had.

Prior to working in cyber, I was in the British Army 🎖️ for 5 years. I got to travel all over the world and served in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
